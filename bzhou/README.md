## File Structure
ID3.py    ---- decision tree implementation program

votes.csv ---- Converted data set file for "Congressional Voting Data"

monks.csv ---- Converted data set file for "Monks-1"

wine.csv  ---- Converted data set file for "Wine Data"

result_votes. txt -- results generated by the program on the  "Congressional Voting" data set

result_monk1. txt -- results generated by the program on the  "Monks-1" data set

result_wine. txt -- results generated by the program on the  "Wine" data set

Readme.md  ---- readme file

writeup.pdf   ---- the writeup of the results of all the homework problems


## To run the program
Our program is developed in Python3. To re-create this experiment you need to have a Python 3 compatible build environment.

To run this program, issue the following code in command line under the containing folder 
```
python3 ID3.py filename.csv
```
The argument will be the file that contains the data set that you want to run the algorithm on.


## Parameter of data sets
To change the size of training set and test set, go to line 65, 66 and change the second parameter of function *randomSplit*, which represents the percentage of the second argument on the right:
```
trainData, testData = randomSplit(inputData, 0.2)
train, valid = randomSplit(trainData, 0.2)
```
For instance, the first line of above code will result in spliting the *inpuData* into two parts randomly, 80% of *inpuData* to be *trainData* and 20% of *inpuData* to be *testData*. The second line will divide the *trainData* into to parts in the same fashion.
